### Gas Fees

- A small fee paid by users to compensate for the computing energy required to process and validate transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

### Gas in Ethereum

- The term gas refers to the unit that measures the computational work required to execute operations on the Ethereum network.
- Gas fees are paid in ETH and priced in Gwei. The gas price incentivizes miners to prioritize transactions.

### Types of Gas

- Gas Limit - Max amount user is willing to pay for a transaction.
- Gas Price - Amount user pays per unit of gas.
- Gas Used - Actual gas consumed by the transaction.

### Public Key Cryptography

- Uses key pairs - a public key and private key - to secure data through cryptographic algorithms.
- The public key can be shared openly. Private key must be kept secret.
- Used extensively in blockchains for transaction validation.

### Private Key

- A secret key used to sign blockchain transactions to prove ownership.
- Allows users to access and control their digital assets.
- If lost or stolen, assets can be taken, so it must be kept safe.

### Seed Phrase

- A sequence of words generated from the private key as a backup to recover wallet access if the private key is lost.
- Also referred to as a mnemonic phrase or recovery phrase.
- Usually 12-24 words long. Essential to keep the seed phrase secure.

### Gas Limit

- The maximum amount of gas (or maximum transaction fees) a user is willing to spend on a transaction.
- Prevents runaway execution consuming all ETH in wallet.
- If the Gas Limit is too low, transaction will fail.

### Ether Denominations

1 ETH = 1,000,000,000 Gwei

1 Gwei = 1,000,000,000 Wei
