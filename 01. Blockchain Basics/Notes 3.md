## Chapter 1 - Blockchain Basics, Part 3

### Consensus Mechanisms

- How blockchains achieve agreement on the state of the network
- Allows nodes to validate transactions without central authority
- Common types: Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, Delegated Proof of Stake

[Blockchain Consensus Models Explained](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain-consensus-mechanisms-cryptocurrency.asp)

### Proof of Work

- Miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles to create new blocks
- Requires significant computing power and energy
- Used by Bitcoin, Ethereum (for now)

[What is Proof of Work?](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp)

### Proof of Stake

- Validators stake crypto tokens to secure right to validate blocks
- Less energy intensive than PoW
- Used by Ethereum 2.0, Cardano, Solana

### Delegated Proof of Stake

- Token holders vote for delegates to validate transactions
- Increases scalability compared to direct PoS
- Used by EOS, Lisk, Ark

### Purpose of Smart Contracts

- Automate execution of agreements between parties
- Remove need for middlemen and manual oversight
- Transactions only occur when conditions met
- Speed, efficiency, transparency benefits

[Why are Smart Contracts Useful?](https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts)

### Problems Smart Contracts Solve

- Manual agreements require trust in third parties
- Prone to errors, delays, unnecessary costs
- Smart contracts are immutable and transparent
- Automatically enforce contractual terms

### Minimize Trust

- Smart contracts minimize need to trust counterparties
- Agreement executed exactly as coded by neutral blockchain
- Don't need to trust that other parties will hold up their end
- Trust replaced by cryptographic proof

### Need for Smart Contracts

- Traditional contracts have many limitations
- Manual, paper-based, prone to errors and abuse
- Blockchain smart contracts are transparent, secure, efficient
- Automate complex business and legal logic
