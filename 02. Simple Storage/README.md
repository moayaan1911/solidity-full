# Chapter 2: Simple Storage Contracts

Welcome to Chapter 2 of the Blockchain Basics course. In this chapter, we explore Solidity contracts that demonstrate fundamental concepts such as arrays, structs, and state variables. Below, you'll find resources and links to the available content.

## Resources

### SimpleStorage Contract

- [SimpleStorage.md](SimpleStorage.md): This Markdown file explains and provides the code for the first SimpleStorage contract, which covers basic contract functionality and a favorite number storage feature.

### SimpleStorage2 Contract

- [SimpleStorage2.md](SimpleStorage2.md): This Markdown file explains and provides the code for the updated SimpleStorage contract, which introduces structs and arrays for managing Person data structures.

## Contract Files

### SimpleStorage.sol

- [SimpleStorage.sol](Simple%20Storage.sol): The Solidity source code for the first SimpleStorage contract.

### SimpleStorage2.sol

- [SimpleStorage2.sol](Simple%20Storage%202.sol): The Solidity source code for the updated SimpleStorage contract with arrays and structs.

## Running Contracts

To interact with the contracts and deploy them, you can use online Solidity development tools like [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org).
